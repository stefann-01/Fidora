Fidora Web3 Project

Fidora is a decentralized truth‚Äêverification platform built around Twitter claims. Users can turn a tweet into a ‚Äúclaim,‚Äù allow others to secretly bet on whether it‚Äôs true or false, and then resolve outcomes via a randomly selected jury. Over time, Fidora becomes a community-driven truth oracle‚Äîand we can aggregate results to rate how often individual Twitter accounts post claims that are ultimately proven true or false.

1. Project Overview

    Decentralized Truth Oracle
    Fidora lets users turn any tweet into a verifiable ‚Äúclaim.‚Äù Bettors stake native currency on ‚ÄúAgree,‚Äù ‚ÄúDisagree,‚Äù and a jury resolves the claim. Because bets and votes are kept secret, there‚Äôs no herd mentality‚Äîeach decision is based on individual judgment and cryptographic randomness.

    Jury-Based Resolution
    Jurors pre-stake to join a pool. After betting ends, a random subset of jurors is selected. They vote on the claim: ‚ÄúAgree,‚Äù ‚ÄúDisagree,‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnprovable.‚Äù If all vote, the outcome is computed, losing bettors‚Äô funds are distributed to winners, and jurors earn rewards. If any juror fails to vote, that juror is penalized and voting restarts.

    Rating Twitter Accounts Over Time
    By recording each claim‚Äôs final outcome on-chain, Fidora can track which Twitter accounts tend to post accurate or inaccurate statements. Over time, the platform can compute a ‚Äútruth score‚Äù for each account, helping users judge reliability.

    Randomness Sources

        Flare RNG: If isFlare = true, Fidora uses Flare‚Äôs on-chain RandomNumberV2 via ContractRegistry.

        Pyth RNG: If isPyth = true, Fidora uses a custom RandomNumberSource that queries Pyth‚Äôs randomness.

10. Security Notes

    Secret Betting: Bets are recorded via ZkPlaceholder (a dummy zk implementation). Replace with a production zk system before mainnet.

    Randomness:

        If isFlare == true, ensure the Flare ContractRegistry is correctly pointed to a deployed registry on Coston2.

        If isPyth == true, fund RandomNumberSource with enough tokens to pay oracle fees.

    Juror Penalties: Jurors risk partial stake loss (20% per miss, up to 80%) before removal. Tune these parameters based on community size.

    Refund Paths: For ‚ÄúUnprovable‚Äù or ‚ÄúUndecided‚Äù outcomes, all staked funds (bets + juror stakes) are refunded.

    Account Rating: Track each tweet‚Äôs final outcome on-chain to compute a rolling ‚Äútruth score‚Äù per Twitter account. Do not rely solely on a single claim‚Äîaggregate over many claims to avoid bias.
